**Overall:**
Great work on this! I only put a few quick notes below. Keep practicing your Python and read up on more foundational math/stats, as they will become more and more important as we move along.

**Some notes**  
* I'd read a book called _"subversively non-gaussian"_.
* How might an outlier "spike" your models?
* You can also test for collinearity via a correlation matrix or some form of regression test!
* Another goal of exploratory analysis is to find out if there is anything we have to _do_ to the data. You may have heard that most data scientists spend lots of time working with _data cleaning_, well this is what we mean! Ask yourself questions like: are there outliers in this dataset? Is there any data missing? Are there any errors in the data? Are there any manipulations we have to do?
